    Jarad Anthony Higgins (December 2, 1998 â€“ December 8, 2019), known professionally as Juice Wrld 
    (pronounced "juice world"; stylized as Juice WRLD), was an American rapper, singer, and songwriter
    from Chicago, Illinois. His 2018 single "Lucid Dreams" has been played on the music streaming platform
    Spotify over one billion times and peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. "Lucid Dreams",
    along with his earlier hit single "All Girls Are the Same", helped him secure a recording contract with
    Lil Bibby's Grade A Productions and Interscope Records. He derived his stage name from late American rapper 
    Tupac Shakur's role in the film Juice and stated that it represents taking over the world. He is considered 
    as a leading figure in the emo-rap and SoundCloud rap genres which garnered mainstream attention during the 
    mid-late 2010s.

        "All Girls Are the Same" and "Lucid Dreams" were two of five singles included on Higgins'
        debut studio album Goodbye & Good Riddance (2018), which went on to become certified Platinum
        by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album enjoyed positive critical 
        reception, and contained three other singles: "Lean wit Me", "Wasted", and "Armed and Dangerous",
        all of which charted on the Hot 100. After collaborating with Future on the mixtape Wrld on Drugs 
        (2018), Higgins released his second studio album Death Race for Love (2019) alongside the singles
        "Robbery" and "Hear Me Calling"; Death Race for Love debuted at number one on the Billboard 200,
        becoming the artist's first album to top the chart.

           Higgins died following a drug overdose at Chicago's Midway International Airport. His first posthumous album, Legends Never Die (2020), debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. The album was the most successful posthumous chart debut in over 20 years and matched a record for the most top-ten song entries on the Hot 100 at one time. The album's fourth single "Come & Go" with Marshmello became Higgins' second song to reach number two on the Hot 100 after "Lucid Dreams".
